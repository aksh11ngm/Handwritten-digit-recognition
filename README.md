# Handwritten-digit-recognition
In this project I have used different classifiers to recognize the digit(0-9) drawn by the user.
The dataset used to train the data was taken from the sklearn library.
Different classifiers used are-1)SVM,2)Gaussian Naive Bayes,3)Decision Tree Classifier,4)Perceptron,5)Linear SVC,6)Random Forest,7)K-Nearest Neighbour,8)Gradient Boosting Classifier
